# Godot Roguelike-ish example

Demo project for a very simple roguelike game following [Thoughquake's tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1UGbUlzH4)
for a game in this same context.

This game is just a prototype for goofing around and learning purposes, and I plan to keep fiddling with it some more. It's currently **unfinished**.

This should not be used as reference or anything on the matter, as this repository has several problems.

All sprites and tilesets used here are **completely open source**.

### Features

- Procedual level generation
- Score system
- Multiple levels


### Known bugs

- Doors may spawn out of the walls
- Rooms may be created without doors
- Visibility layer only works for the visible screen on level creation, outside boundaries are always clear
- Score system not showing values on the UI
